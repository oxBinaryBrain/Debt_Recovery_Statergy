    <h1>Debt Recovery Strategy Project</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>This project aims to analyze a bank's debt recovery strategies for delinquent accounts. The bank assigns delinquent customers to different recovery strategies based on the expected amount the bank believes it will recover from the customer. By analyzing historical data and developing predictive models, the goal is to optimize recovery efforts and maximize the amount of debt collected.</p>

    <h2>Project Structure</h2>
    <p>The project is structured as follows:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Data Collection</strong>: Gather data on delinquent accounts, including the amount owed, length of delinquency, customer demographics, and previous recovery attempts.</li>
        <li><strong>Segmentation</strong>: Divide delinquent accounts into segments based on expected recovery amounts.</li>
        <li><strong>Recovery Strategies</strong>: Determine different recovery strategies for each segment, such as debt settlement negotiations, payment plans, or legal action.</li>
        <li><strong>Analysis</strong>: Analyze historical data to determine the effectiveness of each recovery strategy for different segments.</li>
        <li><strong>Modeling</strong>: Develop predictive models to forecast expected recovery amounts for each segment based on customer attributes.</li>
        <li><strong>Optimization</strong>: Use optimization techniques to allocate resources to different recovery strategies to maximize overall expected recovery amount within budget constraints.</li>
        <li><strong>Evaluation</strong>: Continuously monitor the performance of recovery strategies and adjust them as needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Reporting</strong>: Present findings and recommendations to relevant stakeholders within the bank.</li>
    </ol>
