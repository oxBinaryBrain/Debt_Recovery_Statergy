## Debt Recovery Strategy 
This project aims to analyze a bank's debt recovery strategies for delinquent accounts. The bank assigns delinquent customers to different recovery strategies based on the expected amount the bank believes it will recover from the customer. By analyzing historical data and developing predictive models, the goal is to optimize recovery efforts and maximize the amount of debt collected.
